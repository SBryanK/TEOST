Privacy Policy — EdgeOne Security Test (Mock)

Effective date: 2025-09-16

This Privacy Policy explains how the EdgeOne Security Test mobile application (the “App”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information about you when you use the App. Please read this policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as described herein.

If you do not agree with any part of this Privacy Policy, you should not use the App.

1. Who We Are

The App is provided by the project owner/operator of EdgeOne Security Test (collectively, “we”, “our”, or “us”).

Contact: aaa.edgeone.com

2. Scope of this Policy

This policy covers personal information and other data processed by the App and its backend components, including services provided via Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) and email delivery providers used by the backend (for example, SendGrid). It also covers local data stored on your device (Room database and DataStore) and background processing performed via WorkManager.

3. Information We Collect

- Account Information

  - Email address and Firebase user ID when you sign in with Firebase Authentication.
  - Optional profile attributes exposed by your identity provider (e.g., display name).

- App Usage and Test Data

  - Targets you input (e.g., domain names, URLs, IPs) and test configuration parameters.
  - Test execution results and metrics (e.g., latency, status codes, selected headers). Sensitive payloads are not stored; request/response bodies are not persisted by default. Where logs are kept, they are redacted to avoid sensitive data.
  - Credits usage and token request metadata (e.g., requested amount, request ID, status).

- Device and Technical Information
  - Device model, OS version, app version, language/locale, and network type may be inferred in the course of normal app/network operations.
  - IP addresses and general network metadata are processed transiently to run your requested connectivity/security tests.

We do not intentionally collect precise geolocation. We do not request access to your contacts, photos, or sensor data.

4. How We Use Information

We use your information to:

1. Authenticate you and maintain your session.
2. Provide core features: connection checks, security test configuration and execution, history view, and export.
3. Maintain your domain favorites and last successful searches for convenience.
4. Process credit requests and display your remaining credits.
5. Operate, protect, and improve the App, including fraud and abuse prevention, troubleshooting, and security monitoring.
6. Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.

5) Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK/Similar Jurisdictions)

Where required by law, we rely on the following legal bases:

- Performance of a contract: to provide and operate the App and its features you request.
- Legitimate interests: to safeguard the App and our users, prevent misuse, and improve reliability and security (balanced against your rights and freedoms).
- Consent: only where we ask for and you provide consent for optional features or communications.
- Legal obligation: to comply with applicable laws.

6. Data Storage and Retention

- Local storage: The App stores certain data on your device via Room (history cache) and DataStore (preferences such as language, last search cache). You can clear this by using in-app controls (where available) or by uninstalling the App.
- Cloud storage: Account data, credit request metadata, and basic test result records may be stored in Firebase (Firestore/Cloud Storage) under your user ID. We retain this data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the App. We may retain some records as necessary for security, fraud prevention, or legal compliance. Upon request, we will delete or anonymize personal data as required by applicable law.

7. Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell your personal information.

We may share information with:

- Service Providers/Processors: Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) for backend services; email delivery providers (e.g., SendGrid) for administrative notifications (such as credit approvals). These providers act under contracts consistent with applicable data protection laws.
- Authorities: If required by law, legal process, or to protect rights, property, or safety.
- Business transfers: If we undergo a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as permitted by law.

8. International Transfers

Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own (for example, Firebase regions chosen for the project, which may include the United States and/or the European Union). Where required, we use appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, to protect personal data transferred internationally.

9. Security

We employ technical and organizational measures to protect information, including:

- Industry-standard transport encryption (TLS).
- Firebase-managed encryption at rest for cloud data.
- Network Security Configuration that trusts only system CAs and disallows user-added CAs.
- Redaction of sensitive values before logging. The App avoids storing request/response bodies by default.
- Least-privilege access and authentication controls for backend components.

No method of transmission or storage is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security.

10. Your Responsibilities

The App is intended for testing only with domains and systems for which you have authorization. You are responsible for ensuring your use complies with applicable laws, contracts, and organizational policies.

11. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to:

- Access, correct, or delete personal data we hold about you.
- Object to or restrict certain processing.
- Port data to another service.
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.

To exercise your rights, contact us at the address in Section 1. We will respond as required by applicable law.

12. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children. Do not use the App if you are under the age of consent in your jurisdiction (e.g., 13 in the U.S., 16 in parts of the EU) without appropriate parental/guardian consent and compliance with applicable laws.

13. California Privacy Notice (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a California resident, the following applies:

- Categories collected: Identifiers (email, user ID), internet/network activity related to the App’s operation, and service usage information (e.g., credits). Sensitive personal information is not collected for inferring characteristics.

- Sale/Share: We do not sell or “share” your personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA.

14. Third-Party Links and Services

The App may include links or deep links to external services (e.g., administrative approval links). Your use of third-party services is governed by their privacy policies; we are not responsible for their practices.

15. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. If we make material changes, we will provide notice as required (e.g., in-App notice or version update). The “Effective date” at the top will be updated.
